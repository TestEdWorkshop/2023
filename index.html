                    <p>The Software Testing Education workshop (TestEd) will aim to identify and promote best practices in software testing education, including curriculum design, inclusivity, engagement, and industrial relevance. TestEd will feature different types of sessions and invite submissions at all educational levels.</p>
<p>TestEd 2023 will focus on knowledge diffusion. The research community has created enormous amounts of knowledge on how to test software, yet many professional software engineers have little of this knowledge. This is despite the fact that testing is crucial to the success of all types of modern software products. On the other hand, the gap between software testing academia and industry demands/trends has not been narrowed. We will specifically focus on two goals. First, how can we teach more testing within computing degrees? Second, how can we better teach the knowledge and skills of software testing? Many members of the ICST community teach software testing at their universities. This workshop will allow those who teach testing to share their ideas, for those in industry to share their experiences and demands, and for us all to learn more about teaching software testing.</p>

                    <p>The Second International Software Testing Education Workshop (TestEd 2023), co-located with the 16th IEEE International Conference on Software Testing, Verification and Validation (ICST 2023), focuses on knowledge diffusion of software testing—especially promoting best practices in software testing education. The research community has created enormous amounts of knowledge for how to test software, yet many professional software engineers have little of this knowledge. This is despite the fact that testing is crucial to the success of all types of modern software products. We will specifically focus on two goals. First, how can we teach more testing within computing degrees? Second, how can we better teach the knowledge and skills of software testing? This workshop will give an opportunity for those who teach testing to share their ideas, for those in industry to share their experiences and demand, and for all of us to learn more about teaching software testing.</p>
<h3 id="topics-and-types-of-contributions">Topics and types of contributions</h3>
<p>Topics include—but are not limited to—teaching materials, active classroom exercises, theory vs. practice, how to solve classroom problems, how to teach specific skills (e.g., test design, test automation, etc.), how to teach students to think like a tester, and professional ethics. Shared experiences could come from courses at any level in academia or industry. It could also come from teaching a dedicated course in software testing or a software engineering course where testing is a small part. Our goal is to have a minimum of “talk at” and a maximum of “sharing with.” Hence, we are looking for multiple types of contributions, including traditional paper-based presentations, talks about specific strategies and tactics, and demonstrations of classroom activities and nifty assignments. We also welcome you to organize an activity such as a group discussion about tricks of the trade or an audience-focused panel to answer questions about teaching software testing. We accept:</p>
<ul>
<li>Full papers (6-8 pages, to be included in proceedings)</li>
<li>Short papers (2-4 pages, to be included in proceedings)</li>
<li>Talk proposals (1 page, not in proceedings)</li>
<li>Demonstration activities and nifty assignments (1 page, not in proceedings)</li>
<li>Panels and group discussion proposals (1 page, not in proceedings)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="submission">Submission</h3>
<p>Full and short papers must conform to the two columns IEEE conference publication format and must be submitted in PDF format via <a href="https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=tested2023">EasyChair</a>. These submissions will be evaluated according to the relevance and originality of the work and to their ability to generate discussions between the participants of the workshop. Three reviewers will review each paper and all the accepted papers will be published as part of the ICST proceedings.</p>
<p>Proposals for talks, demonstration activities and nifty assignments, discussions or other need not conform to the publication format but should be limited to one page, and submitted in PDF via EasyChair. These submissions will be evaluated according to several criteria, including novelty, potential for participants to learn, and maturity of the planned session. Three reviewers will evaluate each proposal. All materials for accepted contributions, including slides, summaries, and lesson plans, will be published on a public website.</p>
<h3 id="important-dates">Important Dates</h3>
<ul>
<li>Paper submission: 27 January 2023</li>
<li>Notification: 17 February 2023</li>
<li>Camera-ready: 3 March 2023</li>
<li>Workshop date: TBC</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="submission-site">Submission Site</h3>
<p>Submissions must be uploaded on EasyChair: <a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=tested2023">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=tested2023</a></p>
